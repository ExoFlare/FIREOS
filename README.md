# FIREOS
A fast implementation of IREOS in Julia. Please find the usage page by running `` julia fireos_cli.jl -h `` or refer to some examples in `` examples.txt ``.

## Installation

To avoid issues regarding compatibility and versioning it is recommended to install FIREOS via the Project.toml file. This must only be done once to install all dependencies.

1. run `` julia --project=/path/to/FIREOS ``
2. switch to Pkg mode by pressing `` "]" ``
3. run `` instantiate ``
4. FIREOS can now be run!
